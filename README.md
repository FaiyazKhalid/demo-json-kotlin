# Android Kotlin Demo 2 Retrofit

Retrofit is type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc. It is an open source library which simplifies HTTP communication by turning remote APIs into declarative, type-safe interfaces. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
